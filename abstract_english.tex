This thesis discusses the gamification or use of game elements in non-game contexts, as well as its potential use in education to enhance student motivation and involvement. The use of technology helps to increase the effectiveness of training. Mobile devices are designed to be powerful mini-computers, and the potential for learning on these devices is growing. This means that people can learn using interactive technology whenever and wherever they wish using their own personal devices. You can add different elements of gamification to different types of training. In the future, it will be possible to integrate this method into state institutions, such as schools and universities.
