\chapter{Pre-existing solutions }\label{ch:4}

\section{Introduction}

It appears that there are several solutions, where people could find decent information for studying algorithms for their purposes. Goals for studying algorithms could vary from preparing for a big tech company's technical interview to passing an assignment or understanding general principles behind popular frameworks. Discouragingly, there are too few good services that could be helpful for one's aims. Popular solutions such as Video lectures or textbooks could contain a lot of unnecessary information and can be time consuming on its own. In addition to that they could contain misinformation. As an example Binary Search algorithm, which has been described in several textbooks contained wrong implementation causing Integer Overflow problem. Generally, for finding middle element it was common to add high and low elements dividing by two. However, right implementation for finding middle element would be subtracting high element to low element, dividing the product. \\

\section{Market research}

Other solutions like: AlgoExpert, Brilliant, GeekForGeeks or CP-algorithms may contain vague information or could be too focused for a specific group of users.
Let's tackle them one by one:

\subsection{Brilliant}
Brilliant focuses on general STEM knowledge and has a variety of topics, but it lacks in depth and focus. It is good for learning the general idea about STEM subjects and to improve your erudition. In addition to that it has good visuals and interactive content mostly consisting of small puzzles. However, it is not a place to learn and deeply understand algorithms and data structure, which could be implemented in day to day work. \\

\subsection{GeeksForGeeks}
GeeksForGeeks is very similar to W3Schools.com with the focus on general Computer Science topics. However, it lacks good structure and organization of topics. In addition to that, their website's UI and UX makes it more difficult to navigate and find the content you need. In most cases, people find topics in GeeksForGeeks through search engines such as Google, instead of using GeeksForGeeks. It is good for finding general information about a specific topic and quickly learning it. \\

\subsection{AlgoExpert }
AlgoExpert focused more on interview preparation. It has a built in coding environment and a video explanation for each coding problem. Their coding problems are hand-picked for coding interview preparation only. It is good for preparing for coding interviews in a short amount of time. \\

\subsection{CP-algorithms}
CP-algorithms is similar to GeeksForGeeks, but the content is only focused on algorithms related to competitive programming, but the explanations of the topics are more deep and advanced, which makes it definitely not beginner friendly. \\

\section{Ultimate Solution}
The purpose of this project is to provide the solution to learn algorithms in a structured way with proper depth and free of charge. It won't be as surface level as brilliant but won't go too deep like cp-algorithms. Our project is also more foundational and not too focused on specific things like AlgoExpert. It also will be easier to navigate compared to GeeksForGeeks and you will be able to track your progress. \\

So to conclude, our project combines the good sides of our competitors and provides a more well-rounded solution.
